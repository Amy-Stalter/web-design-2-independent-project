      <h3>Things to consider before you start to live stream</h3>
        <p>So,you are thinking about starting to live stream, well you have come to the right place! When you start to stream, it's not always about being amazing at the things you stream, or having expensive equipment. When you stream it's about the passion and love that goes into wanting to share your hobbies with others and creating a community of like minded people. Streaming might seem difficult at first, sometimes it's hard to get viewers, or subscribers for your content, but they will all come with time and perserverance.</p>

      <h3>How to make your space work for everything you need</h3>
        <p>Sometimes having one desk just never feels like enough, so here are some simple tricks and tips to take advantage of your space. First off, getting any sort of desk top riser or monitor arm is a a good idea, either allows you to raise your monitors off your desk so it gives you more space to work work with. A bonus is that some table top risers have storage and drawers for clutter management. Second thing you can do to make your space work for you is getting a peg board. This allows you to work with vertical storage rather than having to clutter the floor with drawer storage, or having to get a new desk all together. Lastly, getting a comfortable chair for your work space. Having a chair that is ergonomic, and comfortable can help you with your posture if you are sitting down for a portion of the day. There are such a variety of chairs catering to specific spinal support, and other needs that will elevate your space for your needs.</p>
